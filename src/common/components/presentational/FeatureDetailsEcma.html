<p>Currently there are several proposals for new features or syntax to be added to JavaScript. These include decorators, async-await, and static class properties. These are often refered to as ES7, ES2016, or ES.Next features, but should realistically be called proposals or possibilities, since the ECMAScript 2016 specification hasn't been written yet, and might include all or none of those features. TC39 divides proposals into 4 stages. You can see the current state of various proposals on Babel's website.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us in terms of terminology? The following list might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ECMAScript</strong>: A language standardized by ECMA International and overseen by the TC39 committee.  This term is usually used to refer to the standard itself.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The commonly used name for implementations of the ECMAScript standard.  This term isn't tied to a particular version of the ECMAScript standard, and may be used to refer to implementations that implement all or part of any particular ECMASCript edition.</li>
    <li><strong>ECMAScript 5 (ES5)</strong>: The 5th edition of ECMAScript, standardized in 2009.  This standard has been implemented fairly completely in all modern browsers</li>
    <li><strong>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)/ ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015)</strong>: The 6th edition of ECMAScript, standardized in 2015.  This standard has been partially implemented in most modern browsers.  To see the state of implementation by different browsers and tools, check out <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">these compatibility tables</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>ECMAScript 2016</strong>: The expected 7th edition of ECMAScript. This is scheduled to be released next summer.  The details of what the spec will contain have not been finalized yet</li>
    <li><strong>ECMAScript Proposals</strong>: Proposed features or syntax that are being considered for future versions of the ECMAScript standard.  These move through a process of five stages: Strawman, Proposal, Draft, Candidate and Finished. </li>
</ul>
