<p>
    React bindings for Redux embrace the idea of separating presentational and container components. If you're not familiar with these terms, read about them first, and then come back. They are important, so we'll wait!

    Finished reading the article? Let's recount their differences:

            Purpose
        </th>
        <td>
            How things look (markup, styles)
        </td>
        <td>
            How things work (data fetching, state updates)
        </td>
    </tr>

            Aware of Redux

            No

            Yes

    <tr>
        <th>
            To read data
        </th>
        <td>
            Read data from props
        </td>
        <td>
            Subscribe to Redux state
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
            To change data
        </th>
        <td>
            Invoke callbacks from props
        </td>
        <td>
            Dispatch Redux actions
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Are written
        </th>
        <td>
            By hand
        </td>
        <td>
            Usually generated by React Redux
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    Most of the components we'll write will be presentational, but we'll need to generate a few container components to connect them to the Redux store.
</p>
<p>
    Technically you could write the container components by hand using <code>store.subscribe()</code>. We don't advise you to do this because React Redux makes many performance optimizations that are hard to do by hand. For this reason, rather than write container components, we will generate them using the <code>connect()</code> function provided by React Redux, as you will see below.
